## VM-Series on AWS Gateway Load Balancer Lab

In this lab, you will deploy a real-world VM-Series topology based on reference architecture and gateway load balancer. 

This will be a similar topology to the other GWLB lab, but this lab will be deployed with AWS networking components and routing already setup properly. Instead, we will focus on how to use SCM for AWS Deployments and touch on some more advanced concepts such as decryption.

This is a learning lab, so there are some items you must troubleshoot and figure out on your own!

There is a detailed lab guide hosted on [github](https://github.com/PaloAltoNetworks/lab-aws-gwlb-vmseries/blob/main/README.md).

The secret information, such as license keys and ssh keys can be downloaded from within this QwikLabs console.

## Instructions

- Download `Student Lab Details` from QwikLabs
  
- Download PEM (or PPK) from QwikLabs for later use

- Click Open Console from QwikLabs and authenticate to your on-demand AWS account

- Reference the [full lab guide](https://github.com/PaloAltoNetworks/lab-aws-gwlb-vmseries/blob/scm/README.md) on github.

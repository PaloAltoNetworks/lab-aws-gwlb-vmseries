## VM-Series on AWS Gateway Load Balancer Lab

In this lab, you will deploy a real-world VM-Series topology based on reference architecture and gateway load balancer. You will use Terraform to deploy the base infrastructure and then explore various services and features. This is a learning lab, so you will have to troubleshoot and figure out how to fix routing to make the traffic flows work.

There is a detailed lab guide hosted on [github](https://github.com/PaloAltoNetworks/lab-aws-gwlb-vmseries/blob/main/README.md).

The secret information, such as license keys and ssh keys can be downloaded from within this QwikLabs console.
